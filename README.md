# Mission to Mars

In this web-scraping project the following items were accomplished:

*  A python file using splinter, beautiful soup , CromeDriverManager and CSS was developed initially to ultimately create a scraping.py file.
*  A flask app was created to write an html and store these scraped items in MongoDB 
*  An index.html interface was written to style and post this data
